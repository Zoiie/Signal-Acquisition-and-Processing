Project description

The project is structured in three parts:

Part I: generate a full scale consisting of 12 semitones

For the first part of our project, we are asked to generate a range of music, starting from note La3 at 440 Hz. To do that, we can address the following steps:

‚Ä¢ Start from ùëì0=440 ùêªùëß and multiply this frequency by r = 1.05946 to go to the next frequency (semitone),
‚Ä¢ Generate the full scale made up of 12 semitones, each of duration equal to few hundreds of ùëöùë†, and listen to the signal,
‚Ä¢ Up / down two ranges,
‚Ä¢ Play two consecutive scales with both hands, ...

Matlab plays music by the sound (Y, fs, bits) function. The three parameters of this function represent the input signal, sampling rate, and bit rate. Let me talk about the setting of the sampling rate fs, the sound range that the human ear can hear is 20 ~ 20000Hz. According to the sampling theorem, fs only needs to be greater than 40,000. The sampling rate is set here using the MP3 standard, that is, fs = 44.1k. Besides, the input signal Y, Y is generally a sine wave, such as A \* sin (2 \* pi \* w \* t). Among them, A controls the size of the sound, w controls the level of the sound, and the range of t controls the length of the sound. Therefore, in theory, any sound can be produced using this formula, but the tone and quality cannot be controlled. The default bit rate is sufficient, and this parameter is omitted.

Therefore, the standard sound la can be played using the following formula:

fs=44100;
t=0: 1/fs: 0.5;
la = sin(2\*pi\*440\*t);
sound(la, fs)
Based on the above, we can get all the tones of the piano.

end

Part II: transcript the music notes from some audio input recording

This part aims to transcript piano music at the basic level. That is, one note is played at a certain time. The piano audio samples provided come from a real source (piano recording), therefore the audio file itself is not perfectly sound in tune. Some of the problems needed to solve are overtone analysis, noise reduction and frequency separation.

Fast Fourier Transform (spectrogram) or wavelet analysis (scalogram) should be used for time-frequency analysis (a good explanation of these two analysis methods can be found at: http://mudasir.hubpages.com/hub/wavelets1).

For example, using Matlab, we will be able to create a spectrogram/scalogram of the audio signal.

HINT: we may need to perform low-pass filtering before the time-frequency analysis.

we will need to write algorithms for frequency quantization and de-noising, and finally plot the extracted notes against their duration. In Figure 5 we have an example of such transcription obtained for the sample audio file _piano.wav._

Piano sheet music

The yellow area in the figure is the note corresponding to the sound played by the piano keys. The size of the area reflects the strength of the sound and the range of overtones.
Compared with the shortcomings that the overtone can not be displayed in the example, this can express the characteristics of the piano sound more.
According to part1, we can get all the simulated keys sound.
Add a command on the basis of Part1 to convert the analog signal into a sound file and store it.

audiowrite(&#39;z.wav&#39;,legend1,fs);

Put this file in the Part2 program for analysis to get its sound score.
As shown in the figure, they can hardly make overtones, and after a delay, the sound will not change.

**Part III: watermark the audio input with some text information**

Once the notes are extracted, propose a method for inaudibly inserting a text message (for example, the name of the project developer) within the wav file. Therefore, in this part we are requested to perform the watermarking (either by LBS, or frequency-based) of our wav file. Finally, and if we still have time, estimate the SNR after the watermarking and propose some directions for improving it [1,2].

First, I wrote a program to measure the signal-to-noise ratio to check whether the SNR has changed after modifying the audio file. (Take ech7 as an example)

%Test program

[X, fs] = audioread (&#39;ech7\_filter.wav&#39;);
[Y, NOISE] = noisegen (X, 10);
mn = mean (NOISE);
snr = SNR\_singlech (X, Y)

function snr = SNR\_singlech (I, In)
% Calculate the signal to noise ratio function
% I: original signal
% In: noisy signal (ie. Original signal + noise signal)
snr = 0;
Ps = sum (sum ((I-mean (mean (I))). ^ 2));% signal power
Pn = sum (sum ((I-In). ^ 2));% noise power
snr = 10 \* log10 (Ps / Pn);
end

function [Y, NOISE] = noisegen (X, SNR)
% noisegen add white Gaussian noise to a signal.
% [Y, NOISE] = NOISEGEN (X, SNR) adds white Gaussian NOISE to X. The SNR is in dB.
NOISE = randn (size (X));
NOISE = NOISE-mean (NOISE);
signal\_power = 1 / length (X) \* sum (X. \* X);
noise\_variance = signal\_power / (10 ^ (SNR / 10));
NOISE = sqrt (noise\_variance) / std (NOISE) \* NOISE;
Y = X + NOISE;
end

Result:

![](RackMultipart20220116-4-1h3fgu7_html_66011452482bbb65.png)

In matlab, we can edit the header information of the file to add a watermark. This is actually a frequency-based method. The voice signal is decomposed into time-domain waveforms or frequency-domain graphics. For example, the spectrogram generated by Fourier transform. Restore them to the specified audio format, which can be mp3, wav and other audio formats, this is the reverse conversion process. Here, I still restore to wav file. Use the audio writing function to restore the processed sound frequency to sound and store it. We modify its header information will not affect the original sound signal.

[y,fs1]=audioread(&#39;ech7\_filter.wav&#39;);
audioinfo(&#39;ech7\_filter.wav&#39;)
audiowrite(&#39;ech7\_filter\_watermark2.wav&#39;,y,fs1,&#39;BitsPerSample&#39;,16,&#39;Comment&#39;,&#39;This is my new audio file.&#39;,&#39;Title&#39;,&#39;Final&#39;,&#39;Artist&#39;,&#39;zhouyu&#39;);
sound(y,fs1);
audioinfo(&#39;ech7\_filter\_watermark2.wav&#39;)

Result:

![](RackMultipart20220116-4-1h3fgu7_html_2d94adab85a550d5.png)

Test its signal-to-noise ratio:

![](RackMultipart20220116-4-1h3fgu7_html_3bae636e493695a8.png)

Based on the results above, it seems that I changed the &#39;comment&#39; &#39;artist&#39; &#39;title&#39; of the file, and neither the SNR nor &#39;totalsamples&#39; of the sound changed. The effect met expectations and performed very well.
